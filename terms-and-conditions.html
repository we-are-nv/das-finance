          <h1>Links to Other Websites</h1>
          <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by
            the Company. </p>
          <p>The Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or
            practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company
            shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be
            caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on

          <p>We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites

          <h1>Termination</h1>
          <p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
            whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
          <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
          <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
          <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
            suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
            limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased
            anything through the Service.</p>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be
            liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
            limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for
            personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use
            the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in
            connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the
            possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
          <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
            consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
            party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
          <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
          <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and
            defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company,
            on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service
            providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
            respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
            performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no
            warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
            requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications,
            systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be
            error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
          <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
            representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
            Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service
            will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information
            or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails
            sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware,
            timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
          <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
            You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
            greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
          <h1>Governing Law</h1>
          <p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of
            the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or
            international laws.</p>
          <h1>Disputes Resolution</h1>
          <p>If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute
            informally by contacting the Company.</p>
          <h1>For European Union (EU) Users</h1>
          <p>If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the
            country in which you are resident in.</p>
          <h1>United States Legal Compliance</h1>
          <p>You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States
            government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a &quot;terrorist
            supporting&quot; country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited
            or restricted parties.</p>
          <h1>Severability and Waiver</h1>
          <h2>Severability</h2>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed
            and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
            applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
          <h2>Waiver</h2>
          <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation
            under these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at
            any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
          <h1>Translation Interpretation</h1>
          <p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service.
            You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>

            taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at Our sole discretion.</p>

            by the revised terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the
