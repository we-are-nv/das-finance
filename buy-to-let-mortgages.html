					<div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
						<p>The buy to let sector in particular has seen a host of new regulations. Nowadays, portfolios are being
							handled differently and changes to lender criteria. As a result, applications that would have previously
							met mainstream criteria are now being classed as requiring specialist products, meaning traditional
							lending options no longer work for them.</p>
						<p>DAS Finance in Southend keeps up with the times. We are fast paced and constantly adapt, meaning we can
							provide valuable expertise in this ever-changing market. Our professional and knowledgable team has access
							to a wide variety of exclusive finance products, and will use both their experience and DAS’s unique
							line-up of lenders to help you select the best option for you.</p>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>We provide:</h3>
						<ul role="list">
							<li>Interest Only Available Options</li>
							<li>Rates from 1.49% on Individual name</li>
							<li>Rates from 2.49% on Limited Company</li>
							<li>Up to 85% LTV</li>
							<li>No Early Repayment Charge products are available</li>
							<li>Free Valuations available</li>
						</ul>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>What is a specialist buy-to-let mortgage?</h3>
						<p>A specialist buy-to-let mortgage is an application that does not necessarily meet the criteria of the
							mainstream lenders. Examples range from clients with a less than perfect credit history, to those looking
							to re-mortgage an investment property, to clients wanting leniency in rental calculations. We work with a
							panel of lender partners to identify which finance plan makes the most sense for you in your Buy To Let
							venture.</p>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>‍Why should I get a buy-to-let mortgage?</h3>
						<p>Buying a buy-to-let property can be a great way to make money, but it&#x27;s important to know what type
							of mortgage you need before buying. There are a number of different options available so it&#x27;s well
							worth shopping around to get the best deal for you.</p>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>Compare buy-to-let mortgages</h3>
						<p>When comparing buy-to-let mortgages, it is important to consider:</p>
						<ul role="list">
							<li>The interest rate. Buy-to-let mortgage rates can vary quite a lot, but they tend to be higher than the
								best residential mortgages. This is because buy-to-let investors are usually riskier than homebuyers and
								require higher returns on their investment.</li>
							<li>The fee structure. For example, some lenders offer free products or discounts for transferring
								accounts from other banks or building societies. You may also want to look at any arrangement fees that
								may apply if you take out additional products with them such as insurance or credit cards.</li>
							<li>The product itself, including whether it&#x27;s fixed rate or variable rate (variable rates tend to be
								lower), whether there&#x27;s an early repayment charge and what the term of your mortgage is.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>Buy-to-let Remortgages</h3>
						<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a remortgage rather than a new purchase (which means switching from another
							lender), make sure that your existing lender will allow you this option too and also check how much
							interest you&#x27;ll have saved by doing so as this could help determine whether getting rid of your
							existing deal makes financial sense.</p>
						<p>There are several factors that affect how much you can borrow. These include:</p>
						<ul role="list">
							<li>your income</li>
							<li>your credit score</li>
							<li>the amount of deposit you have saved</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The amount of money you can borrow is also affected by whether or not you have any existing mortgage
							commitments and whether or not you have recently purchased another property. The lender will consider how
							long it has been since your last mortgage application, as well as how much time has passed since a
							previous purchase.</p>
						<p>There are a number of requirements for a buy-to-let mortgage, including:</p>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>Homeowner Status</h3>
						<p>You may need to be a homeowner. This means that before you can apply for a buy-to-let mortgage, you need
							to have owned (and still own) your primary residence—and this home needs to be paid off. The reason? In
							order to get approved for a loan and avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI), banks require that you
							already have enough equity in your first house so that they can feel comfortable lending money on another
							property. </p>
						<p>If they don&#x27;t feel confident in the value of your primary residence, then they&#x27;ll likely
							require PMI coverage instead—and while PMI is required less frequently than it was in the past due to
							recent regulations, it&#x27;s still something that many people want to avoid as much as possible because
							it adds more expense over time.</p>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>Down-payments on a buy to let mortgage</h3>
						<p>You may need at least 25% down payment saved up when applying for any type of home loan (including
							buy-to-let mortgages). This helps ensure that borrowers are able to keep up with their monthly payments
							without having problems later on if rates rise unexpectedly or prices fall unexpectedly—both situations
							which could cause homeowners significant financial hardship if not prepared properly beforehand.</p>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>Interest-Only buy to let mortgages</h3>
						<p>If you’re wondering whether or not to get an interest-only buy to let mortgage, the answer is yes, they
							are available. But there are some things to consider before you apply:</p>
						<ul role="list">
							<li>Interest only buy to let mortgages usually have higher interest rates than residential mortgages. This
								means that your monthly payments will be higher, too.</li>
							<li>Interest only buy to let mortgages usually have shorter terms than residential mortgages. This means
								that your repayments will end sooner than if you had a normal residential mortgage with 25 years left on
								it (which would mean paying off the entire loan).</li>
							<li>Interest only buy to let mortgages normally have higher LTVs than residential ones as well - so check
								with your lender about this point before applying for one!</li>
						</ul>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>UK Minimum rental income 2022</h3>
						<p>In the UK, a mortgage lender may require you to have a minimum rental income of at least 75% of your
							monthly mortgage payment. This means that if you want to borrow £150k on a 5-year fixed rate with 2%
							interest, you need to be able to show that your monthly rental income will be at least £1,000 (75% of
							£150k).</p>
						<p>If you don&#x27;t have this income then some providers may still consider lending but with higher
							interest rates or additional security requirements such as guarantors or additional deposits.</p>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>Remortgaging a buy to let mortgage</h3>
						<p>You can remortgage a buy to let mortgage. This means that you can take out a new loan to pay off your
							current one. As long as you are still paying the mortgage on your property, then you can remortgage it
							again and again.</p>
						<p>You can remortgage a buy to let if:</p>
						<ul role="list">
							<li>You want to decrease the amount of interest paid each month</li>
							<li>You want a better rate of interest</li>
							<li>You want to shorten the length of the term</li>
						</ul>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>One way to ensure the a good deal is to get experts at DAS Finance to investigate the options available
							for you.</h3>
						<p>To make an accurate and educated decision regarding buy to let mortgages, you need to know what you are
							looking for and understand the market. You will also need to be able to compare the different deals that
							are available. Finally, you need to be able to make an informed decision about which mortgage is right for
							you so that when it comes time for your monthly payment, it won&#x27;t break the bank!</p>
						<p>‍</p>
						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p>If you are looking to buy your first property, you might want to consider getting a mortgage to ease cash
							flow concerns. But, if you already have a home and want something extra, then you may consider a
							buy-to-let mortgage. There are lots of different options available on the market today so it&#x27;s worth
							shopping around before making any decisions. DAS can ensure an honest and efficient process designed to
							make complex finance easy.</p>

												<p class="faq__paragraphs">Buy-to-let mortgages work much like any other mortgage. You put down
													a deposit, and borrow a percentage of the purchase price of the property as a mortgage. There
													are usually two types: interest-only, and capital repayment. With an interest-only mortgage,
													your monthly payments are smaller because they only cover the interest you’re incurring each
													month – and the balance you borrowed initially must be repaid as a lump sum, when the term of
													your mortgage ends. <br><br>With a capital repayment mortgage, your monthly payments are
													larger and cover both the interest and what you initially borrowed – so when the term ends,
													you own the property outright. In addition, you can choose between a fixed-rate and a
													variable-rate mortgage. If you choose a fixed-rate, your repayments are locked in for a set
													period at the start of your mortgage, while on a variable-rate mortgage the interest can be
													varied by the lender (after giving you a bit of notice). Because of this, fixed-rate mortgages
													offer more peace of mind, but tend to have a slightly higher interest rate.</p>
